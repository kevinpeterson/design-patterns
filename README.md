design-patterns
===============
Example Design Patterns in Java. I find it much easier to understand these patterns after I've seen them in code. Since some of these I haven't used much, here is a spot to practice.

Setup
-----
Import into Eclipse, Intellij, or whatnot.
This is a Maven project, but there are no dependencies set.

Patterns
--------
These are the patterns to focus on:
* Factory Method
* Builder
* Prototype
* Flyweight
* Memento
* Proxy
* Visitor
* Template Method
* Mediator
* Command
* State
* Factories
* Singleton
* Object Pool

Contribute
----------
__Please send Pull Requests!!!!__
Just make sure there is a ```main``` method or some obvious way to start things up.
